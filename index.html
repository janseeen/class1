          <h2>What are Watermelons???</h2>
          <p class="text">
            A watermelon is the large fruit of a plant of the gourd family, with
            smooth green skin, red pulp, and watery juice. Watermelon (Citrullus
            lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family
            and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing
            vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with
            more than 1,000 varieties. Watermelon is grown in favorable climates
            from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible
            fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions,
            and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually
            deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties
            exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible
            after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient
            in mixed beverages. Kordofan melons from Sudan are the closest
            relatives and may be progenitors of modern, cultivated
            watermelons. Wild watermelon seeds were found in Uan Muhuggiag, a
            prehistoric site in Libya that dates to approximately 3500 BC.
            Watermelons were domesticated in north-east Africa, and cultivated
            in Egypt by 2000 BC, although they were not the sweet modern
            variety. Sweet dessert watermelons spread across the Mediterranean
            world during Roman times.[4] Considerable breeding effort has
            developed disease-resistant varieties. Many cultivars are available
            that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting. In 2017,
            China produced about two-thirds of the world's total of watermelons.

        Cube watermelons, or square watermelons are watermelons grown into the shape of a cube. These watermelon are usually sold in Japan and are also expensive. They can go up to 200$ per melon.Cube watermelons were intended to fit more compactly in fridges and their shape makes them easier to cut as they don't roll. They were invented by graphic designer Tomoyuki Ono in 1978. He presented the watermelons in a gallery in Ginza, Tokyo. He also applied for and received a patent in the United States.
          The melons are grown in boxes and take the shape of the container, and they tend to appeal to wealthy or fashionable consumers. In 2001, square watermelons sold for Â¥10,000 in Japan (about US$83), two to three times the price of regular watermelons in Japanese stores. In the United States in 2014, some sold for $200.
          Although cube melons were originally created with practicality in mind, the cost is prohibitive. The cube shape of the watermelon can only be achieved at the expense of its contents. To retain the proper shape, cube melons must be harvested before they are ripe, rendering them inedible.
          Since the advent of the cube watermelon, other watermelon shapes have been introduced, such as hearts and pyramids. They are also available in other countries now, such as in Germany.

        As you might guess, yellow watermelon is a variety that gets its name from its bright golden flesh. On the outside, the striped green rind of both the red and yellow varieties look exactly alike. However, your traditional variety gets its red color from lycopene, an organic pigment and powerful antioxidant also found in tomatoes and grapefruits. Since the yellow variety does not contain lycopene, it doesn't turn red. Yellow watermelons are actually as natural as red watermelons. That being said, farmers selectively bred watermelons to have the vibrant red that they have now.
